          <a class="accordion-btn">I already have menus made of paper, why is your digital menu
            better?</a
          >
          <div class="accordion">
            Our digital QR code menu is contactless and it’s always "on the
            table". Guests don’t have to wait for the waiter to bring them a
            menu or search for the menu on their own. The less waiting time and
            actions needed to make an order, the more orders will be made.
            <br />
            <br />
            Paper menus can’t be edited, there is no way to create promotions
            and discounts quickly.
            <br />
            <br />
            To maintain the relevance and presentable look of a paper menu, it
            has to be reprinted from time to time
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="service-box underline">
          <a class="accordion-btn">I already have a QR code menu with a PDF file, how is your digital
            menu different from this?</a
          >
          <div class="accordion">
            The PDF file is not interactive. It inherits all the disadvantages
            of a paper menu. Your QR code menu looks like a text based price
            list, and not like a modern store page that is made to increase your
            sales.
            <br />
            <br />
            You cannot add photos and descriptions for every item to the PDF
            menu, it will immediately become huge and unreadable.
            <br />
            <br />
            When you scan QR code of a PDF menu, you need to download it to your
            phone, which can be problematic with low Internet connection speed
            or if your guests just don't like to download anything to their
            phones.
            <br />
            <br />
            PDF menus, once again, cannot be quickly edited. You have a new type
            of cheesecake? Now you have to redo the entire PDF and re-upload it
            to your hosting. In our digital menu, a similar operation takes 20
            seconds and is easily performed even with your Android or iPhone.

          <div class="accordion">
            No, you don’t have to. You can edit your QR code menu whenever you
            want. We have designed an administrator interface that makes it easy
            to edit your menu from both desktop and mobile devices.
            <br />
            <br />
            We can also give your employees access to your digital menu so that

            Of course. You can try our digital menu service first, and then
            decide, does it suits your business or not. To try it you don’t need
            to add your credit card info or pay for a subscription. Our QR code
            menu is free of charge for a full month.
            <br />
            <br />
            All you need to do is to create an account and we will automatically

          <div class="accordion">
            Your old QR codes will work if you change the name of your
            restaurant, cafe or bar. Or if you will change anything else in your
            digital menu.
            <br />
            <br />
            Even the link, leading to your digital menu, can be changed at any
            time, and the old QR code will still work.
